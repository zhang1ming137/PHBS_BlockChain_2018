# 1.Introduce the history, influence of hard fork of Bitcoin and the mechanism of different types of fork currencies. 
1.1 introduction
Different parties need to use common rules to maintain the history of the blockchain. When parties are not in agreement, alternative chains may emerge and fork happens. Forks can be classified as accidental or intentional. Accidental fork happens when two or more miners find a block at nearly the same time. The fork is resolved when subsequent block(s) are added and one of the chains becomes longer than the alternative(s). Intentional forks that modify the rules of a blockchain can be classified as hardfork and softfork. Hardfork broadens the protocol and makes previously invalid events valid. Softfork tightens the protocol and makes previously valid transactions are invalid.
The block size of the BTC network is currently limited to 1MB. This means during congestion, as people compete to confirm their transactions as early as possible, transaction fee may become very expensive (over 30 dollars per transaction). This fact significantly limits the payment ability of Bitcoin and makes it almost impossible to embed smart contracts in Bitcoin network.
